# IntroToMLPreCodeLab
A codelab to make sure you have the dependencies needed for class.

<h1>Installation</h1>

<h2>Installing dependencies:</h2>

<h3>Microsoft Windows and Mac:</h3>
We recommend installing <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/">Anaconda</a> as it installs Python, 
Jupyter and other libraries needed easily.

<h3>Linux (Debian-based):</h3>
1. On your terminal, run the following code:
sudo apt-get install pip


2. Once you have Pip (Python Package Manager), run the following code on your terminal:<br>

pip install numpy
pip install jupyter
pip install -U scikit-learn


You can also install <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/">Anaconda</a>, but I personally prefer the steps above. It's up to you. :)

<h2>Cloning the repo</h2>

1. Check <b>Set Up</b> section here: http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/

<h1>Using the notebook</h1>
