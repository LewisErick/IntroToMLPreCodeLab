# IntroToMLPreCodeLab
A codelab to make sure you have the dependencies needed for class.

<h1>Installation</h1>

<h2>Installing dependencies:</h2>

<h3>Microsoft Windows and Mac:</h3>
We recommend installing Anaconda as it installs Python, Jupyter and other libraries needed easily. You can find it in the following link:
https://www.anaconda.com/download/

<h3>Linux (Debian-based):</h3>

1. On your terminal, run the following code:<br>

```sudo apt-get install pip```

2. Once you have Pip (Python Package Manager), run the following code on your terminal:

```
pip install numpy
pip install jupyter
pip install -U scikit-learn
```


You can also install <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/">Anaconda</a>, but I personally prefer the steps above. It's up to you. :)
